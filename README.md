Implementation of Inception-v4 architecture in Keras as given in the paper: ["Inception-v4, Inception-ResNet and the Impact of Residual Connections on Learning" by Christian Szegedy, Sergey Ioffe, Vincent Vanhoucke](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.07261v1.pdf). 

The network is pretty big. And due to lack of availability of dataset and limited processing power incapable of running the Neural Network, weights cannot be provided.
